# A.I-Jarvis
Just A Rather Very Intelligent System
Created and Tested on window with Python 2.7
An attempt to make a very simple, Personal Assistant that understands speech as well as text input and is capable
of performing tasks other than conversing. This project is based on AIML 1.0 and uses pyaiml for using the AIML
interpreter in python. AIML, is based on pattern matching and this project does not implement any sort of
machine learning or language processing. Combined with a few python scripts, J.A.R.V.I.S now performs quite a
few tasks:
